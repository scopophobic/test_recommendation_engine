It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. \r\nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions \r\nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have \r\ndemonstrated critical job behaviours. \r\n  \r\nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and \r\ndevelopment situations.

This test is comprised of items that contain a passage that must read in order to answer the question being asked. The questions focus on the ability to demonstrate an understanding of the passage. Questions may be specific in nature, with answers that can be found almost word for word in the passage. For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions that may be asked.",
