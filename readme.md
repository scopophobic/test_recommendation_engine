# 🔍 SHL Assessment Recommender

A smart web-based system that recommends SHL assessments based on natural language job descriptions using LLMs (Gemini API). It extracts constraints like required skills, duration, and job levels, then suggests the most relevant assessments.

> 🚀 Powered by **FastAPI**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Google Gemini API**

## 📦 Features

- 💬 Accepts natural language job prompts
- 🤖 Extracts constraints like skills, duration, and job level using Gemini
- ✅ Matches prompt with SHL assessment dataset
- 🔗 Provides links, duration, keys, and support flags (remote/adaptive)
- 🧾 Clean UI built using React + Tailwind
- 🧠 Scraped ~400+ assessments from SHL’s public catalog
- 🌍 Deployed using Render (API) and Vercel (frontend)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a prompt like:
   > “Looking for a mid-level data analyst with strong Excel and reasoning skills.”

2. Gemini API extracts:
   - Skills: Excel, Reasoning
   - Job level: Mid-level
   - Duration constraint: Optional

3. SHL assessments are filtered and scored based on match.

4. Final top-K assessments are returned to the user with useful metadata.
